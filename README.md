It's another -le game, but with the periodic table! Guess the hidden element based on how close it is to others. The closer it is, the more green your guess will be.

Eventually I might make it a little more fully-fledged, but this will do for now.

Thanks to the contributers/creators of [Periodic-Table-JSON](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON) which I used in this project!
